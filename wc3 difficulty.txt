warcraft 3 difficulty findings

creep aggro is way more aggresive once they engage.
much more naixes, less collision/unit size but try to block you and aggro. 
-I actually died near the first ziggurat (slow poison prevents you from running)
spawn weavers has ~8 weavers melee, which spawn 240 hp spiderlings (10-11 damage). I died here again (enabled god cheat)
add more boars
healing ward heals 30 HP per second
level 6 and 1450 HP when I use the 2nd key
hell has many imps more (low collision), doom guards do chaos damage. 
-I had to use 1 ank and almost die again
2nd miniboss does pure damage, all trolls focus the player. HP got dangerously low.
-After the 1st teleport my stats are 1500HP, 68 damage 7 armor ( I skipped some tomes, but Manual of health might have less drop % )
add more small sludges, more burning archers, fireblast spell on red lizard (high range, high aggro!)
tunnelers follow forever, high aggro
2nd house spawns burning archers, not treants, aggro seems to be shared in all the area
bash does extra damage, 3 kobolds + salamander pack the crap out of me trying to kill the kobold spawner. 1625 HP and 9 armor
add more spiders
-took a +12 claws in the secret area, I'm lvl 10 now with 1950 hP ~100dmg and 8 armor
frost area 2 wendigos engage me at the same time, with 4 frost archers on the back (not particullary hard but)
red drake stats 950 hp 36-47 dmg 2 armor
mid sludges engage way earlier
-game is easy for now
Tank area has good similarities but its impossible to solo without pausing to fully heal, had to enable whosyourdaddy
-add more enemy tanks and some green lizards
Last area
add way more fellhounds, less size less collision. Chaos damage, took 3/4 of my 2.2k HP very fast
big sludges cast frenzy on the skeleton
shadowDancer near harpy nest have 500hp, ~25dmg, many of them
furbolgs, satyrs, soul smashers, infernals have chaos damage, but not particullary dangerous at this point
last satyrs just drop 1 tome
last pack almost kicked my ass, stuns+magic/pure damage and aggro forever, almost die
necromancers do magic damage
2 infernals alone were somewhat a challenge to my 2.3k HP, 110 damage, 65% lifesteal Razor
boss with satyr spawns was relatively easy at the end

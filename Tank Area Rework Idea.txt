Tank Area Rework Idea

- Keep the current terrain and circle trigger, but its fought with the heroes instead of a tank for each.
- Players get moved to the minigame area, tank miniboss is spawned
- Boss uses spells when possible. 
- Spells could be Bomb, Laser, Spawn Robot Add, Call Down.
	- Check reflexdota item_reflex_meteor_cannon and other dodgeable projectile spells
- Miniboss tries to scape / run away from the players, following the labyrinth until the end.
	- Move AI could be for a certain % damage taken, move to the next spot.
	- Reach the end at ~25% HP, add a new  spell.
- Create impassable terrain on the way back as the tank moves forward (maybe damaging lava)
	- so its not possible to back for healing/refresh cooldowns.

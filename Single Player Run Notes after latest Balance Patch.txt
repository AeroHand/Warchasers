Single Player Run Notes (w/ Razor)

Slarks pre 1st miniboss are trash. Make "big murlocs" hit more, have more HP.
Lvl 5 after the 1st miniboss. 26 Tomes dropped
30 Attack Speed on Combat Buff might be useless
Death and Decay (Razor ult) kind of sucks. Probably remove channel
After using the 2nd key, I'm lvl 7 and the pack just dies in 1 lvl 3chain + 2 autos.
Engaging 2nd miniboss with lvl 8, 55 tomes taken and 1.8k HP
Death and Decay doesnt damage the boss
Trolls dont aggro me (luckily, they are too many). Should be less mobs but all focusing the lowest HP
> Script Runtime Error: ...a_addons\warchasers\scripts\vscripts\addon_game_mode.lua:1078: EntIndexToHScript parameter 0: expected integer but got void.

Stats to test the modified area: 2.1k HP 79 damage 9 Armor
Mobs are much more challenging now, HP actually drops
Make Kobold tunnelers dont use creep aggro (follow forever) to increase diff?
Hit lvl 10 before hall of spiders (farmed kobolds)
HellSpiders damage x2 or x3, add some magic resistance so they dont get all wiped in 1 nuke
Frost Level is ezpz, Dragons dont do damage and die in 1sec
Brood is harder to kill now but still no threat.  Trolls heal it for more than what I can damage yet I'm in no danger 
Can't kill these until they run out mana http://puu.sh/cjjRH/f047681c6b.jpg (which is good, but needs more threat)
Might just need to nerf HP tomes to 25 instead of 50. 3.1k HP when I reach the tank area
Tank Area as single player is ok-ish.
Pack with necromancers+dragons+archers could hit a lot harder. Necro Leader hits by 8
0 threat on the next packs still
Shadow Dancers drop a ton of tomes, ton of potions in inferno pack, HP almost drops
I Forgot to close doors on boss engage!
Death and Decay gets cancelled by Void, hits by a ton though.
Boss difficulty is ok, too many potions/healing ward makes it easy though.

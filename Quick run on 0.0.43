Make 1st miniboss aggro not reset until the 3rd stairs
Some ghouls are stuck
Golem pack was hard with the aggro forever mechanic, make it just ~1k range follow
+6k! gold on the first shop. Normalize some item costs (gauntlets, mantles) to account for the new selling system
Make 2nd miniboss + trolls fight at the same time, reduce ammount of trolls
Burning Archer spawning is not working (I forgot to change the skill on the house)
Make burning archer arrows hurt more
Kobold tunneler camp is OP, change the limit to 8
I lost on spider level :D

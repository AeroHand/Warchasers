1). Increase difficulty of later stages of game. Too easy currently.

2). Rebalance healing heroes other non-healing. Maybe add more poitions drops.

3). Nerf healing ward. Or make it high priority.

4). Balance AoE nukes over single target.

5). Make cloack of shadows less useless.

6). Balance out ultimate. Currently too long cooldown to be useful.
